Hello. This is a readme file for MVP CP2.

The file named “CODE” includes all the code files for my CP2 submission.
“GameOfLifeSimulationWithGliderVelocity_d020324_v001.py” is the simulation of the game of life including calculations to calculate the glider velocity.
“GameOfLifeMeasurement_d020324_v001.py” is the code to make the histogram of time needed to reach absorbing state.
“SIRSvisualiseSim_d020324_v002.py” is the code to visualise the simulation of SIRS.
“SIRScontourcalc_d020324_v001.py” is the code to calculate the SIRS contour values and plot the colour map.
“PlotSIRScontour_d020324_v001.py” is the code to plot the SIRS contour.
“SIRS_Var_withErrors_d020324_v001.py” is the code to calculate and plot the cut of variance with error bars.
“Immunity_d020324_v001.py” is the code to for the immunity part of the checkpoint.
“plotimmunity.py” is the code to make the immunity plot.

The file named “RESULTS” includes all the results from the code.

“hist” is the file containing the histogram for the game of life measurement including the datafile.
“glidervelocity” is the file containing the data and plots used to calculate the glider velocity.
“contour” contains the data and plots for the colour maps and contour plots.
“variance” contains the data and plots for the variance part of the checkpoint.
“immunity1” and "immunity2" contains the data and plot for the immunity part of the checkpoint for a 100x100 and 50x50 lattice respectively.
